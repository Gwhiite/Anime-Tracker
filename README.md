				<td>- **Summary**

The `package-lock.json` file serves as the foundation for the entire codebase architecture of the `anime-tracker` project, which appears to be a Vue.js application built with Vite<br>- The primary purpose of this file is to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across the project.

In essence, this file provides a snapshot of the project's dependency tree, specifying the versions of each package required for the project to function correctly<br>- By referencing this file, developers can easily reproduce the project's environment and ensure that all necessary components are installed and up-to-date.

The `package-lock.json` file plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and reproducibility of the project, making it an essential component of the overall codebase architecture.</td>
