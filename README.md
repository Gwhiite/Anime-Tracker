				<td>- **Summary**

The `package-lock.json` file serves as the foundation for the entire codebase architecture of the `anime-tracker` project, which appears to be a Vue.js application built with Vite<br>- The primary purpose of this file is to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across the project.

In essence, this file provides a snapshot of the project's dependencies at a given point in time, ensuring that all packages are correctly installed and versioned<br>- This is particularly important for a Vue.js application, which relies on various third-party libraries and frameworks.

By referencing this file, developers can quickly understand the project's dependency structure and ensure that any changes made to the codebase do not introduce compatibility issues with other packages<br>- Overall, the `package-lock.json` file plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the `anime-tracker` project.</td>
